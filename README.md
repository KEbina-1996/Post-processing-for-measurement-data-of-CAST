# Post-processing-for-measurement-data-of-CAST
This program is post-processing for measurement data of practical laparoscopic surgical training such as cadaver sugical training described in the paper [1].
To measure surgical instrument motion in these training environment with many obstacles and narrow measurement space, the trinocular motion capture system was adopted in this study.
However, the measurement data include some noise and outlier because of this system only measures instruments motion from one direction.
Therefore, three outlier removal method and interpolation and smoothing method were developed in this study. This is a sample program for post-processing.
